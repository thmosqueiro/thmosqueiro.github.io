<h2>Optimizing Star Joins using Hadoop Systems</h2>

<p>
  In collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/jaquejbrito">Jaqueline Brito</a>,
  we are interested in the processing of heavy queries in the Cloud by using
  parallel frameworks such as Apache MapReduce and Hadoop Spark. In particular,
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299426537_Faster_cloud_Star_Joins_with_reduced_disk_spill_and_network_communication">
    we recently studied the processing of Star Joins
  </a>,
  which are very important
  in business intelligence and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
  The figure has a visual representtion of a star join: a central table $F$ is joined with satellite tables $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$ and $D_4$. In OLAP applications, this is a challenge because $F$ is excessively large (at least hundreds of gigabytes).
</p>

<p>
  I am particularly interested in problems involving joins of large tables, and how we can push the boundaries of the state of art when solving such operations. We should have a prepring soon about our latest ideas and experiments! :)

<h2>Notch1 in epithelial cells and calcium signaling</h2>

In collaboration with Dr. Julia Mack, Dr. Guido Faas and the
<a href="https://arispelab.mcdb.ucla.edu/">Arispe Lab</a>
at UCLA, we investigated the interperplay between the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_1">NOTCH1</a> and
dynamics of intracellular calcium involved in cell enlongation

<h2>Communication and dominance contest in weakly electric fish</h2>

<p>
  In collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/rtuma">Rafael Tuma</a>,
  <a href="http://neurobiofisica.ifsc.usp.br/TeamMembers/teammembers.html">Dr. Reynaldo Pinto</a> and
  the <a href="http://neurobiofisica.ifsc.usp.br/">Neurobiofisica Lab</a> at the University of S\~ao Paulo,
  we are interested in understanding whether and how weakly electric fish (often Gymnotus sp.) communicate
  using electric signals. Because these fish are very territorialists,
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292982370_Non-parametric_Change_Point_Detection_for_Spike_Trains">
    we are proposing novel techniques based on time series segmentation
  </a>
  to investigate the establishment of a dominance hierarchy between pairs of (conspecific) fish
  and the how communication shapes the contest for the dominant role.
