title: Fedora 21 on a Macbook Pro 2014
categories: Fedora MacbookPro

OS X is still a challenge for me. It's buggy, extremely closed and is
as far from solving my needs as Windows XP was. I acknowledge a lot of
people love this operating system, however, and I really respect their
opinion. It just does not work for me. I'll post here my experience on
configuring Fedora 21.

Out of the box, there are a few things that do not work quite well.

* Firefox fonts are really, really small
* Jack sound adapter has a red light......!
* Considerable heating when compared to OS X

I'll address these topics as well as other topics, such as which
distribution I've used. For the record, this is a Macbook Pro 13' with
Retina display, late 2014 model.

**Which Fedora spin have I used?**

As matter of fact I have used Fedora Workstation, which is based on
Gnome 3. This is not my first choice as I've been using KDE for a
while now. However, the Retina support seems better on Gnome. I've
tried Fedora with KDE, XFCE and Mate, and with none of them the Retina
display worked out of the box. While you can still fix the font
scaling in KDE, it won't deliver the same quality as Gnome right now.

I have also tried booting my machine with Elementary OS. While they
are doing a damn good job, I think it's not really that stable and I
noticed some minor bugs. I'd totally recommend it to a novice user
used to Debian/Ubuntu based systems.

**Fixing firefox fonts**

Inside your .mozilla folder, find **prefs.js** file. Edit prefs.js and look for the following line:
```
user_pref("layout.css.devPixelsPerPx", "1");
```

Adjust the value (1 above) to whatever you need. For me, 2 worked
really fine. Depending on the model of your Macbook Pro, it may vary
down to 1.5 though.

**Wireless won't work**

Macbooks ship with a Broadcom wireless board, and these may give you a
headache in Linux. At least they used to. After installing Fedora to
my hard drive, the very first thing I did was to hook it to a
smartphone and tethered its connection. It worked without any problem.

Then, I updated the system AND installed the following packages (all three were necessary):
```
su -c 'yum install kernel-devel akmod-wl broadcom-wl'
```
When I restarted the system, wireless was working quite well. No complains at all.

<i>Side note:</i> In other linux distriburions, they already come with
some broadcom drivers. In Elementary OS, for instance, wireless worked
out of the box.

**Qt lacks support to Retina display**

After digging, I've found that in versions 5.1 or bigger HiDPI support
was implementted. However, Fedora 21 doesn't seem to ship with
qt5. I'm experimenting...

**Battery life & overheating**

Of course, these two problems are highly related. Yep, battery life
seems to be reduced when compared to what it was with OS X. Partially,
due to tthings being not very well controlled. I'm still experimenting
with it, but I can tell one thing: although battery applet says I
still have, say, 1h of battery life, it's usually underestimating my
actuall battery life. I'm sure how much this effect counts, but I
wouldn't go back to OS X just because of battery.


**Sleeping**

Sleeping works out of the box: when you close the lid, it triggers
sleep. When you open it again, you'll be prompted with the login
screen. It happened just once that I had to press the power button to
wake the machine up.

The only complain is that it definitely does drain much more battery
during sleep than compared to OSX. This may hinder your usage, but it
is still pretty good. If you don't have much battery, it won't wake up
and will ask for the charge instead. I've tried, for instance, letting
it overnight several times, and for all of them battery was almost the
same as when I closed the lid.
