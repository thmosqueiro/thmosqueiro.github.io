This is a hello world blog post. Hello! =)

<!-- Split Here - Snapshot -->

Here I'll share some thoughts and opinions, as well as use as a
repository of short articles to help with the projects I'm involved
with. My main point here, in this particular blog post, is to test my
Jekyll construction and it seems to be working pretty nice. I hope you
enjoy.
