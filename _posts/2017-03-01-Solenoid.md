When you are working with sensors, you want to have as many repetitions as you can of certain stimuli. For electronic noses, you want to put the nose in contact with those volatiles that interest you. To get improve our precision and automate this repetitive task, we decided to create minimal electronic device that switches a valve open/closed according to some protocol and exposes an electronic nose to a certain odor. Although this is not a completely crazy project, there are subtle details that are worth paying attention to. I will describe below how this was performed..

Thanks a lot for help from Brenno Barbosa, Lirio Onofre and Reynaldo Pinto.

## Testing if the solenoid does work

The first thing we should do is make sure the valve and solenoid are working
properly. A quick way to check that is to pour water into one end of the valve,
and make it open by applying 12V DC. This solenoid valve is directional, and
there is an arrow indicating what is the proper flow direction. When the voltage
is applied, you should hear a click, although no mechanical movement is
appearent (everything is internal!). The water should flow right away. Once you
open the circuit again, you hear another click, meaning that the valve is now
closed again. The click may sound a bit scary at first -- at least I thought I
broke it the first time...

Because I could not find any videos of this solenoid operating in a development
environment, I shot a quick video and posted on YouTube (click below to watch to
it). Note at the bottom-left corner when Jaque closes the circuit by connecting
a black jumper.

## Connecting to Arduino

Here is an sketch of how the final circuit looks like.
