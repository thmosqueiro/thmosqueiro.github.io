I feel very strongly about this topic: gender inequality in science and technology. Partially, because my wife is a PhD candidate in Computer Science. Not to say many friends in academy or industry. This September, I was invited by one of the leaders of the [PyLadies - São Carlos](http://saocarlos.pyladies.com/) chapter to give a brief talk. I loved the idea and decided to speak of some of the many wonderful female scientists I interacted with during my short experience in academia. After the talk, we had an open session to discuss many of the issues that most women still face in science-based careers (both in academia and industry). During this session, I remembered a story that happened almost ten years ago. I decided to share this story and openly acknowledge it.

## Once upon a time...

In my freshman year, we were 40. We were  36 men and four women. This ratio is pretty close to that of almost all physics courses around the world, although this has been changing; slowly, but changing. More precisely, improving. In our first semester, *Introduction to Computer Programming* was mandatory to everyone. The instructor was knowleadgeble and very didactic, except that he loved to stop the class at random points for jokes. I used to find most of them funny. In fact, most of them were about his ex-wife, who - according to him - would love to go to Paris and spend "his" money. Not all jokes were about his wife, many were about women in general. The punch line punctuated how they aren’t that smart, or how much they love spending with makeup, or how they would always look for guys with expensive cars. 

This professor was popular. Everyone was enjoying the jokes and laughing together. Except for those four students. As a matter of fact, especially because this course represents the first contact physics students have with computer programming, the jokes were a bit too often, if not completely inappropriate. 

Obviously, there was a complaint directly to the dean. Maybe this was a bit harsh (going directly to the Dean), but let us move on for now. The Dean, of course, did not enjoy hearing that, and talked to this professor, asking to look out for inappropriate jokes and behave more professionally. 

In the next class, everyone was astonished when the professor started the class explaining what happened: that two female students complained about the jokes, and because of that he would refrain from telling more jokes during classes. And then he said that going to the dean directly was completely unnecessary and exaggerated, as they could have "simply" asked him to stop with the jokes.

The next thing I remember was a fuss,  everyone looking around, trying to figure out who the “two female students” were. Two out of four female students. Hard to beat these odds.

At that time, the victims became the oppressors.

From the perspective of virtually everyone, it was clear that this complaint was unfounded, unfair, and unrealistic. People would say things like, "it's probably that time of the month". Or worse. I do remember having conflicting feelings about this: "but the jokes are funny, what is the matter after all? But if they are complaining, do these things offend them?"

The two students who complained to the Dean did come forward, in front of everyone, and revealed that they were the cause of all that. Their message was very clear:

> We are not comfortable with such jokes, and we want an environment that is minimally professional.

Well, not in these exact words, it’s been more than ten years. But that is close enough. More than anything in this whole issue, this marked me a lot and serves as an example until today that...

After that, the jokes didn't stop.



## My opinion about this matter

I am not convinced that everyone realizes how absurd this situation was. For some, our female classmates were being too obnoxious and lacked a better sense of humor. "Their skin were too soft, they would hardly graduate from such a hard-core science discipline." Guess what? Three of the four did drop college and looked for something else to do with their lives. No surprise for such an unwelcoming environment. I am always happy when I hear about their successes, knowing that this awful experience did not hinder the development of their carriers.

Although this topic is now trending everywhere, women contributed to science and philosophy since the earliest times. [Merit-Ptah was not only chief physician back in 2700 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_medicine#Ancient_medicine) but possibly the first women to enter the history books holding a position related to a scientific field. It seems that the scales have always been unbalanced, however, because the access to higher education has often been either restricted or not very welcoming to all genders. For instance, although there are examples of female scholars during the Middle Ages, the first universities to appear in Europe (circa 1200) disregarded applications from women. It was only in the 1700's when the first female scholar earned an academic chair: [Laura Bassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bassi), a physicist who lived between 1711 and 1778. She is an important example because it shows women *rocking* in hard sciences since the eighteenth century, despite all the adversities. From that point on, many role models rapidly emerged: for starters, [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie), who earned two Nobel prizes; [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), who created the first computer algorithm; [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), the mathematician behind the Noether's theorem that links symmetries with conservation laws (a big deal in physics).

There are plenty of role models, and it is important to recognize and acknowledge them. We start to learn what we *should* and *shouldn't* do when we are kids (e.g., see [this](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023574427720)): children can recognize sex very early, and associate with it sets of objects and actions. In other words, the more we see of "boys play with trucks, girls play with makups", the stronger we associate separate roles for each sex (likely gender too). This discrete view of human behavior generates implicit bias, and directly affects roles of men and women: [men are linked to math, women with liberal arts](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10593.short).

My point here is simple: gender bias is a social construct, and by ignoring its existence and that of female role models we reinforce the idea that science and technology is no place for women. I acknowledge this subject is a really complex field of study(e.g. see [gender development, ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/)), and I will not pretend to be an expert. On the contrary, I believe we should all be reading and discussing more about these issues. It is important to recognize and acknowledge that there is a gender gap in science and technology.

I wonder, among those who teach Noether's theorem, how many of them mention Noether is the name of a female mathematician that was leading a field completely dominated by men? How about teaching how the first computer program, a complex algorithm that evaluates Bernoulli Numbers, was wrighten by a women? It is important to acknowledge the role models whenever possible, because students can then identify to these role models. This kind of connection motivates students to keep growing and challenge themselves. In a way, the story I want to share is an example of subtle behaviors, often seen in academic environments, I believe the number of people mentioning such details is growing, and in many instances thanks to efforts such as PyLadies, RailsGirls, WIDS, etc.

This story became a personal reminder of a situation which I did not recognize immediately. If you, reader, by any chance is one of the two students from the story above, I am sorry I did not stand up and say anything. I do regret this. A lot. But from that mistake, ...

There is no good in sharing names or any more details. It is enough to say that this professor does not work anymore in the same university, and to the best of my knowledge is indeed a good person. He is/was maybe just blind.
