Last november, [Jaque](http://github.com/jaquejbrito) and I went to Spain as
part of a collaboration with the [Universdad Autonoma de Madrid](http://uam.es)
(UAM) and the [Universidad Migual Hernandez](umh.es) (UMH). They were both kind
enough to invite me for a talk during my stay, and UMH even recorded it (video
below). We were really excited with this opportunity to learn more about one of
the countries with most [UNESCO World Heritage
Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/es).

## Presenting my work

This trip happened when I was starting my second year as a Post Doc, working
with an amazing and interdisciplinary team. At that time, I was lucky enough to
be invited to a few conferences and events to talk about my recent work.
Although from slightly different points of view, the main topic was on how large
neural networks can, at the same time, employ fast decision making and stable
representation of patterns. When I presented at the Centro de Investigacion
Operativas, Universidade Miguel Hernandez (UMH), they recorded my talk and
posted it to UMH's YouTube channel (video below). It was a little less than
50min, as requested.

It is certainly interesting to listen to yourself speaking in public. At that
point, the fatigue of the trip was starting to get to me. Regardless, I need to
look out for some words (e.g. "basically" and "like"). If you are interested in
my slides, they are also available here.

## More about our trip

Going to Europe with Jaque was a fantastic experience. It was not only my first
time in Spain, but also Jaque's first time in the old continent. We spent most
of our time in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid) during our trip.
The first place we saw was the Escuela Politecnica of the Universidad Autonoma
de Madrid. We used a nice office there, at the Ada Lovelace Hall (wonderful
name!).

With no doubt, Madrid is one of the cultural capitals of Europe. For starters,
Prado Museum contains one of the finest collections of european art in the
world. As recommended by many friends, we enjoyed the collection of works by
[Francisco de Goya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya). Especially
for people like me, who like darker paintings and movies, Goya has unique style
and technique. Still related to important artistic and historical landmarks, we
visited the Plaza Mayor (first picture below). Another beautiful place to visit
is the Buen Retiro Park, which dates back 500 years. One of its attractions is
the Monument to Alfonso XII, opened in 1922. (second picture below). With
respect to food, we were not so surprised to find many similarities between
Spanish and Brazilian cuisines, which was particularly pleasant as Jaque and I
have been in the US for a while now. Yes, I tried
[paella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paella) and loved it.

Madrid in general has a pretty unique charm.

During a Saturday, we decided to go to
[Segovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia), a UNESCO World Heritage Sites
with a rich historical content and wonderful architecture. It is not clear
exactly how old the city is, but entries in the history books go back to 90 B.C.
The work on Segovia's Cathedral dates back to 1500 -- i.e. it is as old as the
new continent. But I was completely overwhelmed with Segovia's Alcazar (kind of
castle, I guess). It rises on a rocky crag, right above the confluence of two
rivers. The view from the top of the castle is just breathtaking (first
picture below). At some point, royal families lived there, and you can see their
throne, belt room, paintings, decorated ceiling, armory room, etc. By the way,
this castle served as [one for the inspirations to the Cinderella Castle at the
Magic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_Castle). You have to pay
extra to go to the very top of the castle: it is damn worth it! But be prepared
to sweat a bit.

It was pretty cold....

For this trip to Segovia, we had the company of our good friend, [Aaron (Monday)
Montero](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron_Montero_Montero).

Our final destination was [Elche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elche), in the
Valencian Community, another UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2001. Elche's
landscape is also marked by beautiful palm trees (see pictures below!), most of
them protected by the government. Based on the one night we spent in Elche, its
nightlife is perfect for snacks (calamari!!) and good beers. According to my
little research (i.e. google), Elche started as Helike, a settlement formed by
Greeks around 600 B.C. Among the many archaeological remains found in Elche, the
stone bust of the Lady of Elche - or Dama de Elche in Spanish - is a figure that
you can spot seemingly anywhere in the city (see below a replica in black). The
Lady of Elche may date from the Iberian period (4th century BC). Apparently, the
original is now in Madrid, as part of the collection of the National
Archaeological Museum of Spain.

We want to go back as soon as possible, but this time for proper vacation, with
no work. Barcelona and Granada are sure destinies!
