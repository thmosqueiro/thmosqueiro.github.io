<h2>Gas sensors for home activity monitoring Data Set</h2>
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-4 intro">
  <p><a
  href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensors+for+home+activity+monitoring"
  target="_blank">Go to UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></p>
  <p> This dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas
  sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed
  to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and
  banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the
  stimulus close to the sensors.</p>

<h2>iGEM 2015 Interlab Experiment</h2>
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-4">
  <p>The Second International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology
  proposes to detect three promoters activity by measuring and comparing the
  levels of GFP expression of three devices expressing GFP and controlled by one
  of the three promoters (see Figure 1). The three promoters - BBa_J23101,
  BBa_J23106, BBa_J23117 - are from the <a
  href="http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson"
  target="_blank">Anderson library</a>, a constitutive promoter family with
  different strengths. </p>

<h2>iGEM 2015 pVeg promoter in E. Coli</h2>
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-4">
  <p>Pveg is a strong constitutive promoter well studied in Bacillus subtilis,
  especially during the vegetative growth phase and sporulation (controlled
  primarily by the veg gene). Currently available at Registry as BioBrick
  K823003, it was characterized using a β-galactosidase assay by team
  LMU-Munich, as well as published in a recent paper [1]. While originally
  designed for B. Subtilis, during the 2014 iGEM edition Brasil-SP team proposed
  a protocol to express it in E. Coli (DH5α strain). Repeating this procedure
  with a gfp gene, we can now perform experiments similar to the β-galactosidase
  assays and evaluate how strong Pveg is in E. Coli.</p>
